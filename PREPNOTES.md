# LSX Demo Theme – Interview Discussion Notes

## Current Progress

- I understand how **`theme.json`** works and how to export it using the **Create Block Theme** plugin.  
- I followed the **Block Theme Academy** course and built a **basic theme** as part of my learning process.  
- With **Figma**, I have mainly **copied the provided theme**, but I don’t have deep design experience yet. I am willing to take courses to improve my knowledge of Figma and design systems.  
- I downloaded **Harvest Time Tracking**, but I wasn’t fully sure how to **connect it to GitHub**. I do have it installed, just not fully set up.  

## Challenges I Encountered

- **Figma:** I am not yet confident in moving from design assets to theme development. So far, I’ve only been able to copy the provided theme rather than adapt or create variations.  
- **Harvest Time Tracking:** I downloaded it but struggled with linking it correctly to GitHub issues and tasks.  
- **Theme Building:** My current block theme is very basic. I understand the foundations, but I want to ensure I’m following **best practices** for structuring a theme beyond just the basics.  

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Figma**  
   - Should I focus mainly on using the provided design assets, or is it expected that I also create variations?  
   - Is there a preferred workflow for translating Figma styles into `theme.json` settings?  

2. **Harvest Time Tracking**  
   - How exactly should Harvest be integrated with GitHub issues?  
   - Is there a specific setup guide for linking tasks to time logs?  

3. **Theme Development**  
   - Are there specific **best practices** or coding standards your team would like me to follow when structuring the theme?

## Next Steps

- Improve familiarity with **Figma** through short courses/tutorials.  
- Revisit **Harvest integration** with GitHub to ensure proper time logging.  
- Expand the **basic block theme** I created into something more aligned with the LSX design system.  
- Prepare to share both code and process documentation during the discussion.
