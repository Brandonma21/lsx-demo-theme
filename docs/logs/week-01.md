- **Hours:** 8 hours daily
- **Task:** Modified all my profiles and added required information. Also completed modules and tasks I created on Asana.
- **Description:** I learnt about the block theme and the LSX Demo Theme. I used GitHub to start my courses and then moved over to Microsoft Learn. Some challenges I faced with the courses were that some activities required a paid Copilot version, like Agent Mode, for example.
- **Next Steps:** Next steps are moving on to the next week's curriculum and doing those tasks. Along with that, I want to complete some more courses on Copilot and GitHub fundamentals.
