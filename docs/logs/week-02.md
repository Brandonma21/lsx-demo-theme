- **Hours:** 8 hours daily.
- **Task:** Continued working on Copilot modules and explored more on the LSX Demo Theme project structure.
- **Description:** I spent time understanding the LSX Demo Theme, including its use of `theme.json` for global settings and styles. I also reviewed the block patterns and templates used in the theme. This helped me connect the theoretical knowledge from the modules to the practical implementation in the project.
- **Next Steps:** Dive deeper into the LSX Demo Theme and start identifying areas where I can contribute. Additionally, I will focus on improving my workflow by consistently logging time in Harvest.
