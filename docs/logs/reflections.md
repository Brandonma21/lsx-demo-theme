# Internship Reflection

This file is intended for your end‑of‑internship reflection. Use it to capture your thoughts on the overall experience, what you learned and how you plan to grow next.

## Suggested Prompts

Consider addressing the following questions:

- **What were your biggest achievements?**  
  My biggest achievement was learning some fundamentals of Copilot and GitHub.

- **What challenges did you face?**  
  One challenge I faced was with my WordPress account, which was giving me problems. However, I resolved it, and otherwise, I didn’t encounter any other major struggles.

- **How did the tools and workflows support your work?**  
  The tools and workflows made some processes a lot easier. For example:  
  - Creating Asana tasks via Slack was very efficient.  
  - Copilot was an amazing assistant in all areas.  
  - 1Password has been especially refreshing to use.

- **What feedback did you receive and how did you apply it?**  
  I received feedback from Ash about planning tasks and taking notes on critical information. This has been especially helpful because I can be forgetful, and applying this advice has improved my workflow.

- **What are your goals going forward?**  
  My goals are:  
  - To master using Copilot as much as I possibly can.  
  - To learn and be able to apply the standards at LightSpeed.  
  - To get my knowledge to a point where I can start contributing to company projects.

## Structure

Write in Markdown using headings and bullet points where appropriate. The reflection should be candid and introspective; it will not be graded but helps both you and the team improve the onboarding process.
